# Product Requirements Document: Socratic Chat Application

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 7, 2025  
**Document Owner:** Product Team  
**Status:** Draft for Development Team Review

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement & Value Proposition

The Socratic Chat Application addresses the critical gap in discussion-based learning platforms where AI serves as a questioning facilitator rather than an answer provider. Traditional educational chat applications position AI as an information source, creating passive learning experiences. Our platform transforms AI into a Socratic facilitator that guides participants through inquiry-driven conversations, fostering critical thinking, self-discovery, and deeper understanding.

**Core Value Proposition:** Enable meaningful learning through guided questioning, where participants discover insights through dialogue rather than receive direct answers.

**Business Impact:** 
- Increase learning engagement through active participation (target: 40% improvement in session duration)
- Improve knowledge retention through self-discovery learning (target: 30% improvement in post-session assessments)
- Scale discussion facilitation without human moderator constraints

## 2. Product Vision and Philosophy

### Vision Statement
To create the premier platform for AI-facilitated Socratic dialogues that transforms how people learn through questioning and self-discovery.

### Core Philosophy: The Socratic Method
Our application embodies the Socratic method through:

**Question-Driven Facilitation:** The AI facilitator never provides direct answers but guides participants to discover insights through carefully crafted questions.

**Assumed Ignorance:** The AI approaches each topic with the assumption that it doesn't know the answers, encouraging participants to think rather than rely on AI knowledge.

**Dialogue-Based Learning:** Learning occurs through conversational exchange, where each response builds upon previous insights.

**Critical Thinking Development:** Questions are designed to challenge assumptions, explore contradictions, and deepen understanding.

### AI as Facilitator, Not Information Source

The AI facilitator's primary responsibilities:
- Ask probing questions that guide discovery
- Identify and highlight contradictions in participant responses
- Encourage exploration of assumptions and beliefs
- Maintain dialogue flow while preventing information delivery
- Adapt questioning style to participant engagement levels

**System Prompt Implementation Philosophy:**
The AI's behavior is entirely shaped by carefully crafted system prompts that enforce Socratic facilitation principles. These prompts explicitly prohibit information delivery and mandate question-based responses, ensuring consistent philosophical adherence.

## 6. System Requirements

### AI Facilitator System Prompt Architecture

#### Core System Prompt Structure

**Primary Directive:**
"You are a Socratic facilitator conducting a dialogue about [TOPIC]. Your role is to guide discovery through questions, never provide answers or information. You operate under the assumption that you do not know the subject matter and are learning alongside the participant through inquiry."

**Behavioral Constraints:**
1. **Information Prohibition:** "Never provide facts, definitions, or direct answers"
2. **Question Mandate:** "Every response must end with a thought-provoking question"
3. **Assumption Challenge:** "Identify and question unstated assumptions in participant responses"
4. **Contradiction Exploration:** "When inconsistencies arise, guide participants to discover them"
5. **Depth Progression:** "Build questions on previous responses to deepen exploration"

#### Facilitation Style Templates

**Exploratory Style:**
```
Focus on broad discovery and creative thinking. Ask questions that encourage:
- "What if..." scenarios
- Alternative perspectives
- Imaginative possibilities
- Personal connections to concepts
```

**Analytical Style:**
```
Focus on logical reasoning and critical analysis. Ask questions that encourage:
- Cause-and-effect examination

## 8. Out of Scope Items

The following features are explicitly excluded from the initial release to maintain focus on core Socratic dialogue functionality:

### Onboarding and Training Systems
- Comprehensive user onboarding flows
- Interactive tutorials for Socratic method understanding
- Administrator training modules
- Participant preparation materials

**Rationale:** Focus on core functionality first; onboarding can be addressed in subsequent releases based on user feedback.

### Notification and Communication Systems
- Email notifications for session invitations
- SMS reminders for scheduled sessions
- Push notifications for mobile apps
- Real-time alerts for administrators

**Rationale:** Manual session management is acceptable for initial release; automated notifications add complexity without core value.

### Advanced Analytics and Reporting
- Detailed learning analytics dashboards
- Comparative performance reports
- Advanced data visualization tools
- Machine learning-based insights

**Rationale:** Basic metrics are sufficient for validating product-market fit; advanced analytics require substantial data collection first.

### Integration Capabilities
- LMS (Learning Management System) integrations
- Calendar system connections
- Third-party authentication beyond OAuth
- API access for external applications

**Rationale:** Standalone functionality proves value before building integration complexity.

### Mobile Applications
- Native iOS and Android applications
- Offline capability
- Mobile-specific features
- App store distribution

**Rationale:** Progressive Web App approach using responsive design meets initial mobile needs.

### Multi-language Support
- Interface localization
- Multi-language AI facilitation
- Cultural adaptation of Socratic methods
- International deployment

**Rationale:** English-language market validation precedes international expansion.
