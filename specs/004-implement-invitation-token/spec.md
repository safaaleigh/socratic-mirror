# Feature Specification: Invitation Token Handler Page

**Feature Branch**: `004-implement-invitation-token`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement invitation token handler page at /invitations/[token] route to process invitation links generated by the invitation system. This page should validate invitation tokens, display invitation details (sender, discussion info), and provide accept/decline functionality with proper error handling for expired/invalid tokens."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature involves creating a web page to handle invitation tokens
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: invited users (authenticated and unauthenticated)
   ‚Üí Actions: view invitation, validate token, accept/decline invitation
   ‚Üí Data: invitation tokens, discussion details, sender information
   ‚Üí Constraints: token expiration, validation rules
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects appear clear from description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: click link ‚Üí view invitation ‚Üí make decision
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Invitation tokens, discussion details, user responses
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
   ‚Üí Business value focused on user invitation experience
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user receives an invitation link via email or shared directly, clicks the link, and is taken to a dedicated page where they can view invitation details (who invited them, what discussion they're being invited to) and choose to accept the invitation. The system handles various error states gracefully, such as expired or invalid tokens.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user receives a valid invitation token link, **When** they click the link, **Then** they see invitation details including sender name, discussion name, and accept option
2. **Given** a user views a valid invitation, **When** they click "Accept", **Then** they are added to the discussion and redirected to the discussion page
4. **Given** a user clicks an expired invitation link, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see an error message explaining the invitation has expired
5. **Given** a user clicks an invalid invitation token, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see an error message explaining the invitation is not found
6. **Given** an unauthenticated user clicks a valid invitation link, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see invitation details and can provide their name to join as an anonymous participant

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user is already a participant in the discussion they're being invited to?
- How does the system handle invitations to discussions that are no longer active?
- What happens when a discussion has reached its maximum participant limit?
- How does the system handle network errors during invitation processing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate invitation tokens and display appropriate error messages for invalid, expired, or malformed tokens
- **FR-002**: System MUST display invitation details including sender name, discussion name, and description when available
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to accept invitations, which adds them to the discussion and redirects them to the discussion page
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow anonymous users to accept invitations by providing their name, creating them as anonymous participants
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle edge cases gracefully including full discussions, inactive discussions, and duplicate participations
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear feedback for all user actions including loading states, success messages, and error states
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent users from accepting invitations for discussions they are already participating in
- **FR-009**: System MUST respect discussion participant limits and show appropriate messaging when limits are reached

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Invitation Token**: Unique identifier linking to a specific invitation with expiration and validation status
- **Invitation Details**: Information about the invitation including sender, target discussion, personal message, and current status
- **Discussion Context**: Basic discussion information needed for invitation display including name, description, and current participant count
- **User Response**: User's decision to accept the invitation with timestamp and processing status
- **Anonymous Participant**: User joining without authentication, providing only their name for identification
