# Tasks: Core Lesson Management

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-core-lesson-management/`

## Feature Overview
Implement CRUD operations for lessons in existing T3 Stack application (Next.js 15, tRPC 11, Prisma 6.15, NextAuth.js 5.0). No database schema changes required - existing Lesson model supports all requirements.

## Key Implementation Notes

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: tRPC 11 with Prisma 6.15 ORM
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 App Router with React 19
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (existing Lesson model, no schema changes)
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js 5.0 session validation
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for all inputs/outputs
- **Testing**: Next.js testing framework (to be configured)

### Critical Requirements
1. **TDD Enforcement**: All contract tests must fail before implementation starts
2. **State Transitions**: Draft â†’ Published â†’ Archived (no reversals allowed)
3. **Ownership Security**: Only lesson creators can modify their lessons  
4. **Performance**: <2s response times for all lesson operations
5. **Data Integrity**: Existing Lesson model supports all requirements

### File Path References
- **Prisma Schema**: `/prisma/schema.prisma` (Lesson model already exists)
- **tRPC Setup**: `/src/server/api/trpc.ts` (existing patterns)
- **Main Router**: `/src/server/api/root.ts` (add lesson router here)
- **Lesson Router**: `/src/server/api/routers/lesson.ts` (create new)
- **Frontend Pages**: `/src/app/lessons/` (create new directory)
- **Test Files**: `/tests/lesson/` (create new directory)
