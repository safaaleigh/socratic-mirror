# Research: Core Lesson Management

**Feature**: Core Lesson Management (001-core-lesson-management)
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Research Phase**: Complete

## Technical Stack Analysis

### Decision: Use existing T3 Stack architecture
**Rationale**: Project already has well-established T3 Stack (Next.js + tRPC + Prisma + NextAuth) with lesson-related models already defined in schema. Extending existing patterns is more efficient than creating new architecture.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Standalone microservice - rejected due to complexity overhead
- Different ORM - rejected as Prisma already handles lesson models well

### Decision: Extend existing Prisma Lesson model
**Rationale**: Current Lesson model in schema.prisma already has most required fields (title, description, content, objectives, facilitationStyle, keyQuestions, isPublished, isArchived, lifecycle states). Minor additions needed for status transitions.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Create new LessonManagement model - rejected as existing Lesson model is comprehensive
- Use separate versioning table - deferred as existing model supports basic versioning

### Decision: Implement tRPC lesson router
**Rationale**: Project uses tRPC for type-safe API operations. Existing pattern in codebase shows routers in `/src/server/api/routers/` with composition in `/src/server/api/root.ts`. 

**Alternatives considered**:
- REST API endpoints - rejected as project standardizes on tRPC
- GraphQL - rejected as project uses tRPC throughout

### Decision: Next.js App Router for UI components  
**Rationale**: Project uses Next.js 15 with App Router pattern. Lessons page should follow existing patterns in `/src/app/` directory structure.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pages Router - rejected as project migrated to App Router
- Separate frontend framework - rejected as project is full-stack Next.js

## UI/UX Patterns Analysis

### Decision: Follow existing component patterns
**Rationale**: Project uses Radix UI components with Tailwind styling. Existing patterns show form handling with react-hook-form, validation with Zod, and consistent styling with shadcn/ui components.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Different component library - rejected for consistency
- Custom components from scratch - rejected as Radix components work well

### Decision: Sidebar navigation integration
**Rationale**: Feature spec explicitly requires "Lessons" navigation item in sidebar. Need to integrate with existing navigation structure.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Top navigation - rejected as spec requires sidebar
- Floating action button - rejected as spec requires sidebar navigation

## Data Management Patterns

### Decision: Direct Prisma client usage in tRPC procedures
**Rationale**: Existing codebase pattern shows tRPC procedures using `ctx.db` (Prisma client) directly for database operations. No repository pattern or additional abstraction layers.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Repository pattern - rejected for consistency with existing codebase
- Service layer - rejected as tRPC procedures handle business logic directly

### Decision: Optimistic updates with React Query
**Rationale**: Project uses `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching and caching. tRPC integration provides optimistic updates for better UX.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Server-side rendering only - rejected as interactive lesson management requires client-side updates
- Different state management - rejected as React Query is already configured

## Testing Strategy Analysis

### Decision: Follow existing testing patterns
**Rationale**: Project has TypeScript checking configured. Will need to add proper test framework following T3 Stack best practices.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Vitest - good option for T3 Stack testing
- Jest - traditional choice but Vitest is more modern
- Native Node.js test runner - too minimal for this project

**Note**: Testing framework choice will be finalized in Phase 1 design.

## Performance & Scalability Considerations

### Decision: Use tRPC subscriptions for real-time updates
**Rationale**: For multi-user concurrent editing, tRPC supports WebSocket subscriptions for real-time lesson updates.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Polling - rejected due to poor UX and performance
- Server-Sent Events - rejected as tRPC subscriptions provide better typing

### Decision: Implement optimistic locking for concurrent edits
**Rationale**: Prisma supports version fields and optimistic concurrency control to handle multiple users editing the same lesson.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pessimistic locking - rejected as it would block other operations
- Last-write-wins - rejected as it could cause data loss

## Security & Authorization

### Decision: Extend existing NextAuth session handling
**Rationale**: Project uses NextAuth.js with session-based authentication. Lesson CRUD operations will check `ctx.session` in tRPC procedures to ensure only authenticated users can manage their own lessons.

**Alternatives considered**:
- JWT-only authentication - rejected as project uses session-based auth
- Role-based permissions - deferred as spec focuses on user-owned lessons

## Summary

All technical decisions align with existing T3 Stack patterns. No new technologies or architectural patterns required. Focus on extending existing tRPC routers, Prisma models, and Next.js UI components following established project conventions.
