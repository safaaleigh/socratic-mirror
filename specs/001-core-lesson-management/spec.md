# Feature Specification: Core Lesson Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-core-lesson-management`  
**Created**: 2025-01-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "core lesson management - basic CRUD operations for lessons"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an educator, I want to create, organize, and manage lesson content that will guide AI-facilitated Socratic discussions, so that I can prepare structured learning experiences for my students.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they click on "Lessons" in the sidebar navigation, **Then** they are taken to the lessons management page
2. **Given** a user on the lessons page, **When** they click "Create New Lesson", **Then** they are presented with a lesson creation form that includes title, description, objectives, key questions, facilitation style, and suggested parameters
3. **Given** a user filling out the lesson creation form with valid data (title, description, objectives), **When** they save as draft, **Then** a new lesson is created in draft status
4. **Given** a user with an existing draft lesson, **When** they edit and update the lesson content, **Then** the changes are saved and timestamps are updated
5. **Given** a user with a draft lesson, **When** they choose to publish it, **Then** the lesson status changes to published and becomes ready for discussions
6. **Given** a user viewing their lessons list, **When** they access the page, **Then** they see all lessons they have created, organized by status (draft/published/archived)
7. **Given** a user with a published lesson, **When** they choose to archive it, **Then** the lesson status changes to archived and is no longer available for new discussions
8. **Given** a user with their own lesson, **When** they attempt to delete it, **Then** they are prompted to choose whether to let associated discussions complete or immediately end them
9. **Given** a user with an archived lesson, **When** they want to reuse it, **Then** they can fork it to create a new draft version

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to create a lesson without required fields (title, description)?
- How does the system handle extremely long lesson content or objectives?
- What happens if a user loses connection while creating or editing a lesson?
- Can users edit published lessons, and if so, what are the implications?
- What are the limits on the number of objectives and key questions arrays?
- How does the system handle concurrent editing of the same lesson by the same user in different tabs?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a "Lessons" navigation item in the sidebar that is accessible to authenticated users
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove any existing mock lesson entries from the sidebar navigation
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow authenticated users to create new lessons with title, description, and content
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate that lesson titles do not exceed 200 characters
- **FR-005**: System MUST require lesson descriptions to be non-empty
- **FR-006**: System MUST support saving lessons as drafts (unpublished state)
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to specify learning objectives for each lesson
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to define key questions that guide AI facilitation
- **FR-009**: System MUST support setting a facilitation style (exploratory, analytical, or ethical)
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow setting suggested discussion duration and group size as optional parameters
- **FR-011**: System MUST display a list of all lessons created by the current user
- **FR-012**: System MUST track creation and update timestamps for each lesson
- **FR-013**: Users MUST be able to edit existing lessons after creation
- **FR-014**: System MUST support lesson lifecycle states: draft ‚Üí published ‚Üí archived
- **FR-015**: System MUST prevent published lessons from reverting to draft status
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow published lessons to be archived
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow users to delete lessons they created
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide option to either let associated discussions complete or immediately end them when deleting a lesson
- **FR-019**: System MUST maintain lesson versions to prevent affecting ongoing discussions
- **FR-020**: System MUST allow optional updates to be pushed to active discussions when urgently needed
- **FR-021**: System MUST allow archived lessons to be forked for reuse
- **FR-022**: System MUST validate lesson data before saving (required fields, length limits)
- **FR-023**: System MUST preserve lesson ownership - only creators can modify their lessons

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Lesson**: Educational content created by users that includes title, description, content, learning objectives, key questions, facilitation style, and suggested parameters. Has lifecycle states (draft/published/archived) and tracks creation/update timestamps. Belongs to the user who created it.
- **User**: Authenticated individuals who can create, manage, and organize their own lessons. The system maintains lesson ownership per user.
