# Feature Specification: Participant View for Discussion Engagement

**Feature Branch**: `003-participant-view-should`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "participant view should allow invitees to engage in an existing discussion. discussions should have invitation links that can be followed, allow the user to input their name and then enter the discussion."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An invitee receives a discussion invitation link, clicks it, provides their name, and joins an ongoing Socratic discussion where they can participate in real-time conversations with other participants.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid discussion invitation link, **When** an invitee clicks the link, **Then** they are taken to a name entry screen for that specific discussion
2. **Given** an invitee enters their name on the entry screen, **When** they submit, **Then** they are admitted to the live discussion view as a participant
3. **Given** an invitee is in the discussion view, **When** they send a message, **Then** other participants see their message in real-time
4. **Given** an invitee joins an ongoing discussion, **When** they enter, **Then** they can see the recent discussion history to understand context
5. **Given** multiple invitees use the same invitation link, **When** they join, **Then** each enters as a separate participant with their chosen name

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an invitee tries to use an expired or invalid invitation link?
- What happens when an invitee tries to join a discussion that has already ended?
- How does the system behave if an invitee loses internet connection during participation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate unique invitation links for existing discussions that remain valid until the discussion ends
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate invitation links and reject access for invalid or expired links
- **FR-003**: Invitees MUST be able to access discussions through invitation links without requiring account creation or authentication
- **FR-004**: System MUST prompt invitees to enter their display name before joining a discussion
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow multiple participants to use the same display name within a discussion
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow participants to send messages that are visible to all other discussion participants in real-time
- **FR-007**: System MUST display the full discussion history to new participants when they join, with lazy loading for performance when history is extensive
- **FR-008**: System MUST distinguish between different participant types (discussion creator vs invitees) in the interface
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle multiple participants joining and leaving the discussion dynamically
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent participants from joining discussions that have been completed or cancelled
- **FR-011**: Participants MUST be able to leave discussions voluntarily, while only discussion creators can end discussions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Invitation Link**: A unique URL that grants access to a specific discussion, contains discussion identifier and validity information
- **Participant**: An invitee who has entered a discussion, identified by their chosen display name and entry timestamp
- **Discussion Session**: The active conversation space where participants interact, maintains state of who is present
- **Message**: Communication sent by participants, contains sender identity, timestamp, and content
