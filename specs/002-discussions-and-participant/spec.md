## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an educator with published lessons, I want to create discussions based on those lessons and invite participants to join, so that I can facilitate AI-guided Socratic learning experiences with my students.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Discussion Creation Scenarios:**
1. **Given** a user with published lessons, **When** they select a lesson and choose "Create Discussion", **Then** they are presented with a discussion setup form
2. **Given** a user setting up a discussion, **When** they provide a discussion title and optional description, **Then** they can proceed to invite participants
3. **Given** a user creating a discussion from a lesson with a future release date, **When** the release date has not arrived, **Then** the discussion cannot be created until the release date
4. **Given** a user creating a discussion, **When** they save it, **Then** a new discussion is created linked to the selected lesson

**Participant Invitation Scenarios:**
5. **Given** a user with a created discussion, **When** they choose to invite participants by email, **Then** they can enter multiple email addresses to send invitations
6. **Given** a user with a created discussion, **When** they choose to create an invitation link, **Then** they receive a shareable link that allows people to join the discussion
7. **Given** an invited participant, **When** they receive an email invitation, **Then** they can click a link to join the discussion (with account creation if needed)
8. **Given** someone with an invitation link, **When** they access the link, **Then** they can join the discussion (with account creation if needed)

**Participant Experience Scenarios:**
9. **Given** a participant who has joined a discussion, **When** they access their dashboard, **Then** they see all discussions they're part of
10. **Given** a participant in an active discussion, **When** they access the discussion page, **Then** they can see the lesson content and participate in the AI-facilitated conversation
11. **Given** a participant in a discussion, **When** they post a message, **Then** other participants and the AI facilitator can see and respond to it
12. **Given** participants in a discussion, **When** the AI facilitator asks Socratic questions based on the lesson, **Then** participants can respond and engage in guided learning
13. **Given** a participant, **When** they access the application, **Then** they only see lessons for discussions they have been invited to participate in

**Discussion Management Scenarios:**
14. **Given** a discussion creator, **When** they view their created discussions, **Then** they can see participant counts, activity status, and basic metrics
15. **Given** a discussion creator, **When** a discussion is active, **Then** they can monitor the conversation and intervene if necessary
16. **Given** a discussion creator, **When** they want to end a discussion, **Then** they can close it, preventing new messages while preserving the conversation history

**Cohort Management Scenarios:**
17. **Given** a discussion with multiple participants, **When** they are grouped together, **Then** they form a cohort for that specific discussion
18. **Given** a participant in multiple discussions, **When** they access their dashboard, **Then** they can see each cohort they belong to separately
19. **Given** a user creating a discussion, **When** they set a maximum participant limit, **Then** the system prevents additional participants from joining once the limit is reached

### Edge Cases
- What happens when someone tries to join a discussion that has reached its participant limit?
- How does the system handle participants who lose connection during a discussion?
- Can participants leave a discussion once they've joined?
- What happens when an invited participant's email address is invalid?
- How does the system handle invitation links that are shared beyond the intended recipients?
- What happens to discussions when the creator's account is deleted or suspended?
- Can the same lesson be used for multiple concurrent discussions?
- How does the system handle very large discussions with many participants?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Discussion**: A conversation space created from a published lesson where participants engage in AI-facilitated Socratic dialogue. Has a title, optional description, participant limit, and status (active/closed). Links to exactly one lesson and tracks creation timestamp.

- **Cohort**: A group of participants within a specific discussion. Each discussion automatically creates its own cohort. Participants can belong to multiple cohorts from different discussions.

- **Participant**: Users who join discussions to engage in learning conversations. May or may not have pre-existing accounts - the system creates accounts automatically during invitation acceptance if needed.

- **Invitation**: A mechanism to invite people to join discussions, either via email address or shareable link. Tracks invitation status and allows account creation during the join process.

- **Message**: Individual posts within a discussion from participants or the AI facilitator. Includes content, timestamp, and author information. Preserved as part of discussion history.
